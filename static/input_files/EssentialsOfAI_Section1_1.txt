•   Artificial Intelligence (AI): The overarching field of creating machines or systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

•   Computer Vision: A subfield of AI that teaches computers to interpret visual data (e.g., images and videos).

•   Deep Learning (DL): A specialized subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence “deep”) to model and solve complex problems.

•   Generative AI: Generative AI refers to deep-learning models that can generate content based on the data they were trained on.

•   Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI focused on systems that learn from data to improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed.

•   Natural Language Processing (NLP): Another subfield of AI that uses machine learning to allow computers to understand and communicate with human language.

•   Neural Network: A method in AI that teaches computers to process data in a way that is based on the human brain.
