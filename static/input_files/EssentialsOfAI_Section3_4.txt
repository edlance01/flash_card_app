•   Edge Case: Edge cases are unusual or extreme inputs or situations that can cause unexpected behavior in an AI model.    


•  Meta-Prompting: Use prompts to generate or refine other prompts. 


•  Temperature Control: Adjust the "temperature" parameter (if available) to control the randomness of the output. Lower temperature = more deterministic, higher temperature = more creative.  

•  Top-p (Nucleus Sampling): Another parameter to control randomness, focusing on the most likely tokens.
p = 1.0 (No Nucleus Sampling): The model picks from all possible next words.    
p = 0.9: The model selects only from the smallest group of words whose combined probability is 90%.    
Lower p-values: Result in more focused and predictable responses.
