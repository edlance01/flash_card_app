•   Artificial Intelligence (AI): The overarching field of creating machines or systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

•   Algorithm: A set of instructions that tell a computer how to learn and perform tasks.

•   Augmented Reality (AR): Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that combines real-world and computer-generated 3D content.

•   Bias: AI systems can inherit or amplify biases present in the training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. AI bias is the occurrence of biased results due to human biases that skew the original training data or algorithm.

•   Computer Vision: A subfield of AI that teaches computers to interpret visual data (e.g., images and videos).

•   Deep Learning (DL): A specialized subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence “deep”) to model and solve complex problems.

•   Generative AI: Generative AI refers to deep-learning models that can generate content based on the data they were trained on. Generative models work by identifying patterns and distributions in their training data and using those findings to generate new data based on user inputs.

•   Large Language Model (LLM): Not explicitly defined in the text, but described as working on tokens.

•   Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI focused on systems that learn from data to improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed.

•   Model: A trained system that can make predictions or decisions.

•   Natural Language Processing (NLP): Another subfield of AI that uses machine learning to allow computers to understand and communicate with human language.

•   Neural Network: A method in AI that teaches computers to process data in a way that is based on the human brain.

•   Supervised Learning: The AI is trained on data that's already labeled with the correct answers.

•   Training Data: Training data refers to the dataset used to teach an AI model.

•   Unsupervised Learning: The AI is exploring the data on its own to find patterns and group things together.
