• Prompt: A prompt is basically an instruction given to an AI.

• Chain-of-Thought Prompting: You ask the AI model to explain its thought process step-by-step.

• Generative AI Systems: Systems that are designed to generate outputs based on the provided prompts.

• Hybrid Prompting: You combine different prompting methods.

• Improved Responses: AI models can respond better to messages that are clear and contextually relevant.

• Iterative Prompting: You refine your prompt based on the outputs you receive.

• Multi-Shot Learning: You provide the prompt and multiple examples.

• N-Shot Learning (Zero-Shot Learning, One-Shot Learning, Few-Shot Learning, Multi-Shot Learning): A type of learning where the AI model is provided with the prompt and N examples, where N can be zero, one, few, or multiple examples, to guide its learning.

• Negative Prompting: You tell the AI what not to do.

• One-Shot Learning: You provide the prompt and one example.

• Prompt Chaining: You break down a complex task into smaller prompts, then chain the outputs to form the response.

• Audience: The intended group of people that the prompt is targeting.

• Context: The circumstances or situation in which the prompt is given, which helps provide background and meaning.

• Format: The way in which the output or response to the prompt should be structured or presented (e.g., paragraph, list, table).

• Task: The specific action or instruction that the prompt is asking the AI to perform.

• AI Workload: An AI workload is a task that uses artificial intelligence to process data and perform computations.

• Algorithm: A set of instructions that tell a computer how to learn and perform tasks.

• Artificial Intelligence (AI): The overarching field of creating machines or systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

• Augmented Reality (AR): Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that combines real-world and computer-generated 3D content.

• Bias: AI systems can inherit or amplify biases present in the training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. AI bias is the occurrence of biased results due to human biases that skew the original training data or algorithm.

• Binary Classification: Label determines whether an observed item is or isn’t an instance of the specified class.

• Classification: Form of supervised machine learning where the label represents a categorization, or class. In machine learning, classification refers to predicting a discrete category or label.

• Clustering: Form of unsupervised machine learning that identifies similarities between observations based on their features and groups them into discrete clusters.

• Computer Vision: A subfield of AI that teaches computers to interpret visual data (e.g., images and videos).

• Deep Learning (DL): A specialized subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence “deep”) to model and solve complex problems.

• False Negative (FN): The model incorrectly predicted the negative class (Type II error).

• False Positive (FP): The model incorrectly predicted the positive class (Type I error).

• Generative AI: Generative AI refers to deep-learning models that can generate content based on the data they were trained on. Generative models work by identifying patterns and distributions in their training data and using those findings to generate new data based on user inputs.

• Inference: Using the function to predict new values is known as inferencing.

• Large Language Model (LLM): Not explicitly defined in the text, but described as working on tokens.

• Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI focused on systems that learn from data to improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning is the intersection of two disciplines:
  - Data Science: Where we explore and prepare data to train an ML model.
  - Computer Science: Where we integrate models into an application and predict new values (inferencing).

• Model: A trained system that can make predictions or decisions. Fundamentally, a machine learning model is a software app that encapsulates a function to calculate an output value based on one or more input values.

• Multiclass Classification: Label that represents one of multiple possible classes (e.g., genre of a movie based on its cast, director, and budget).

• Natural Language Processing (NLP): Another subfield of AI that uses machine learning to allow computers to understand and communicate with human language.

• Neural Network: A method in AI that teaches computers to process data in a way that is based on the human brain.

• Regression: Form of supervised machine learning where the label predicted by the model is a numeric value.

• Supervised Learning: The AI is trained on data that's already labeled with the correct answers. Supervised Learning – algorithms in which the training data includes both feature values and known label values.

• Training: The process of defining the function is known as training. Machine learning models learn from data in a two-phase process: training and inferencing.

• Training Data: Training data refers to the dataset used to teach an AI model.

• True Negative (TN): The model correctly predicted the negative class.

• True Positive (TP): The model correctly predicted the positive class.

• Unsupervised Learning: The AI is exploring the data on its own to find patterns and group things together. Unsupervised Learning - training models using data that consists only of feature values without any known labels.

• Hallucination: Hallucinations occur when an AI model produces false or misleading information.

• Edge Case: Edge cases are unusual or extreme inputs or situations that can cause unexpected behavior in an AI model.

• Meta-Prompting: Use prompts to generate or refine other prompts.

• Temperature Control: Adjust the "temperature" parameter (if available) to control the randomness of the output.
  - Lower temperature: More deterministic.
  - Higher temperature: More creative.

• Top-p (Nucleus Sampling): Another parameter to control randomness, focusing on the most likely tokens.
  - p = 1.0 (No Nucleus Sampling): The model picks from all possible next words.
  - p = 0.9: The model selects only from the smallest group of words whose combined probability is 90%.
  - Lower p-values: Result in more focused and predictable responses.
