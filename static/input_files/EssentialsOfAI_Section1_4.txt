•	Large Language Model (LLM): AI models trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.   
•	Generative Model: These models are designed to generate new data resembling the training data.
•	Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data (data with known inputs and outputs).  
•	Unsupervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the model identifies patterns in data without labeled outputs.
