•   Supervised Learning: The AI is trained on data that's already labeled with the correct answers. [cite: 3]

•   Unsupervised Learning: The AI is exploring the data on its own to find patterns and group things together. [cite: 9]

•   Large Language Model (LLM): Not explicitly defined in the text, but described as working on tokens.

•   Generative Model: Generative models work by identifying patterns and distributions in their training data and using those findings to generate new data based on user inputs.
